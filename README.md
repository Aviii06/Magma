# Magma
A simple, fast, and tiny renderer written in C++ and Vulkan.

# Coding Style
- Use PascalCase for file names, class names and struct names.
- Use camelCase for private member functions, and PascalCase for public member functions.
- Use m_camelCase for member variables, and s_camelCase for static variables.
- Macros should be in all caps.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use `#pragma once` instead of include guards.
